This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I'm Victor, I am a senior majoring in Computer Info Systems and a minor in cybersecurity. I love to find new ways to make money. I'm busy most of the time, but I like to sleep, shop, or do random activities in my free time. Recently, I've been focused on my long-term goals so that I can have a nice and sustainable future.
